# Exploratory-Data-Week-1-Assignment
This assignment uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, we will be using the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” which I have made available on the course web site:

Dataset: Electric power consumption 
Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

There are project has the following projects;
1. Four plots saved as PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels. Names each of the plot files are as follows plot1.png,plot2,plot3.png and plot4. png
2.Separate R code files
